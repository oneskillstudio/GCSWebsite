**Solution:** Plan adequate testing time, don't rush

### Pitfall 3: Poor Data Migration

**Problem:** Dirty data in new system
**Solution:** Data cleansing upfront, validation testing

### Pitfall 4: Inadequate Training

**Problem:** Users unprepared for go-live
**Solution:** Comprehensive training program, support ready

### Pitfall 5: Lack of Change Management

**Problem:** User resistance, adoption issues
**Solution:** Change management program, communication plan
